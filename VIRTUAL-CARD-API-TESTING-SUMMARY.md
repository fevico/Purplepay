# Virtual Card API Testing Summary

## Testing Date: March 18, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of testing the Virtual Card API endpoints in the Purplepay backend. The testing focused on functionality, input validation, error handling, and security aspects of the API.

## Endpoints Tested

The following Virtual Card API endpoints were tested:

- `POST /card/create-customer`: Create a customer for virtual card issuance
- `POST /card/create-card`: Create a virtual card
- `POST /card/card-transactions`: Retrieve transactions for a virtual card
- `GET /card/card-history`: Get the history of virtual cards
- `POST /card/freeze-unfreze-card`: Freeze or unfreeze a virtual card
- `POST /card/card-details`: Retrieve details of a virtual card
- `POST /card/fund-card`: Fund a virtual card
- `POST /card/withdraw-from-card`: Withdraw funds from a virtual card

## Testing Results

### Functionality Testing

The endpoints are accessible and respond to requests, but several issues were identified:

1. Some endpoints return 500 Internal Server Error with the message "Error fetching data plans":
   - `/card/card-details`
   - `/card/fund-card`
   - `/card/freeze-unfreze-card`
   - `/card/card-history`
   - `/card/withdraw-from-card`

2. The `/card/card-transactions` endpoint returns "Invalid Public Key"

### Input Validation

The endpoints properly validate input parameters:

- `/card/create-customer` requires:
  - customerEmail
  - idNumber
  - phoneNumber
  - zipCode
  - line1
  - houseNumber
  - idImage
  - userPhoto
  - dateOfBirth

- `/card/create-card` requires:
  - customerId
  - name_on_card
  - currency
  - amount

- Other endpoints require a valid card_id parameter

### Error Handling

The endpoints return appropriate error messages when required parameters are missing:

- Missing parameters result in 400 Bad Request responses with specific error messages
- For example, missing card_id results in a "card_id is required" error message

### Security Testing

#### Authentication

The endpoints do not currently enforce JWT-based authentication. This is a security concern that should be addressed.

#### Input Validation

The endpoints perform basic input validation, checking for required fields, but may need additional validation for:

- Data types (ensuring numeric fields contain numbers)
- Value ranges (ensuring amounts are positive)
- String formats (ensuring email addresses are valid)

## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues

1. **Server Errors**: Multiple endpoints return 500 Internal Server Error with the message "Error fetching data plans"
   - **Recommendation**: Investigate the data plan fetching logic and fix the underlying issue

2. **Authentication**: Endpoints do not enforce JWT-based authentication
   - **Recommendation**: Implement JWT authentication for all endpoints

3. **Invalid Public Key**: The card-transactions endpoint returns "Invalid Public Key"
   - **Recommendation**: Configure the correct public key in the environment

### Moderate Issues

1. **Input Validation**: Basic validation exists but could be enhanced
   - **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive validation for all input fields

2. **Error Handling**: Error messages could be more specific
   - **Recommendation**: Improve error handling to provide more detailed error messages

### Minor Issues

1. **Documentation**: API documentation could be improved
   - **Recommendation**: Update API documentation with detailed information about Virtual Card endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 500 Internal Server Error issues:
   - Check the implementation of the affected endpoints
   - Verify that the necessary data plans are available
   - Add better error handling to provide more specific error messages

2. Resolve the "Invalid Public Key" issue:
   - Ensure that the correct public key is configured in the environment
   - Verify the integration with the card provider's API

3. Implement JWT-based authentication for all endpoints:
   - Ensure that all endpoints require a valid JWT token
   - Verify that unauthorized requests are properly rejected

4. Enhance input validation:
   - Add comprehensive validation for all input fields
   - Implement sanitization to prevent injection attacks

5. Add rate limiting:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
   - Configure appropriate rate limits based on endpoint sensitivity

6. Improve error handling:
   - Provide more specific error messages
   - Ensure consistent error response format across all endpoints

7. Add comprehensive logging:
   - Log all API requests and responses
   - Include relevant information for debugging and auditing

## Conclusion

The Virtual Card API endpoints are partially implemented but require several fixes and enhancements before they can be considered production-ready. The most critical issues are the server errors, lack of authentication, and the invalid public key issue. Addressing these issues should be prioritized to ensure the API is secure and functional.
