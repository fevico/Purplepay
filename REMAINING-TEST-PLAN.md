# Purplepay Backend Remaining Test Plan

## 1. Integration Testing

### Wallet and Notifications
- Test that wallet transfers automatically create notifications
- Test that scheduled transfers generate notifications when executed
- Test that security events (adding/removing trusted devices) create notifications

### Wallet and Transaction History
- Verify that all wallet operations are properly recorded in transaction history
- Test filtering and searching transaction history by various parameters
- Test that scheduled transfers create proper transaction records

### Wallet and Security Settings
- Test that high-value transfers require additional authentication when the threshold is set
- Test that security settings changes are properly logged

## 2. Edge Case Testing

### Input Validation
- Test with invalid email formats for recipients
- Test with negative or zero transfer amounts
- Test with extremely large transfer amounts
- Test with special characters in nicknames and descriptions

### Concurrency
- Test multiple simultaneous transfers between the same accounts
- Test creating multiple favorite recipients simultaneously
- Test concurrent modifications to the same scheduled transfer

### Boundary Conditions
- Test transfers exactly at the high-value threshold
- Test scheduled transfers at the boundary of time periods (midnight, month end)
- Test with maximum allowed favorite recipients

## 3. Security Testing

### Authentication and Authorization
- Verify that all endpoints properly enforce authentication
- Test accessing another user's wallet information
- Test modifying another user's favorite recipients or scheduled transfers

### High-Value Transfers
- Test transfers just below and just above the threshold
- Test changing the threshold and its effect on transfers
- Test bypassing the additional authentication requirement

### Trusted Devices
- Test adding multiple trusted devices
- Test accessing the account from untrusted devices
- Test the behavior when all trusted devices are removed

## 4. Error Handling

### Database Errors
- Test system behavior when database connection is temporarily lost
- Test recovery after a failed database operation
- Test handling of duplicate key errors

### Transfer Failures
- Test behavior when a transfer fails due to insufficient funds
- Test recovery from a partially completed transfer
- Test the notification system for failed transfers

### Scheduled Transfer Failures
- Test behavior when a scheduled transfer fails to execute
- Test the retry mechanism for failed scheduled transfers
- Test notifications for failed scheduled transfers

## 5. Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Test with a large number of users performing transfers simultaneously
- Test with many scheduled transfers executing at the same time
- Test with a large number of notifications being generated

### Response Time
- Measure response time for critical operations (transfers, retrieving favorite recipients)
- Test performance with a large number of favorite recipients
- Test performance with extensive transaction history

### Resource Usage
- Monitor memory usage during peak operations
- Monitor CPU usage during scheduled transfer execution
- Test database query performance with large datasets

## 6. API Consistency Testing

### Response Format
- Verify that all endpoints return consistent JSON structures
- Test that error responses follow a consistent format
- Verify that pagination works consistently across all list endpoints

### HTTP Status Codes
- Verify appropriate status codes are used (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Test that validation errors return 400 status codes
- Test that authentication errors return 401 or 403 status codes

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Automated Test Scripts**:
   - Develop scripts for each test category
   - Implement parameterized tests for edge cases
   - Create load testing scenarios

2. **Set Up Test Environment**:
   - Configure a separate test database
   - Set up monitoring for performance metrics
   - Create test users with various configurations

3. **Execute Tests**:
   - Run integration tests first
   - Follow with edge case and security tests
   - Perform performance testing last

4. **Document Results**:
   - Record all test results
   - Document any issues found
   - Create recommendations for improvements

5. **Iterate and Fix**:
   - Address any issues found during testing
   - Re-test after fixes are implemented
   - Update documentation with final results
