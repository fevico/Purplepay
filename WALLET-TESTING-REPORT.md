# Purplepay Wallet Functionality Testing Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the testing conducted on the enhanced wallet functionality in the Purplepay backend. The testing focused on verifying the implementation of features such as favorite recipients, scheduled transfers, transfer notifications, and enhanced security measures.

## Testing Methodology

The testing was conducted using a series of automated test scripts that exercised different aspects of the wallet functionality:

1. **Basic Functionality Tests**: Verified core wallet operations
2. **Edge Case Tests**: Tested boundary conditions and error handling
3. **Integration Tests**: Verified interactions between different components
4. **Security Tests**: Validated security measures and authentication

## Test Results

### 1. Favorite Recipients Functionality

| Retrieving favorite recipients | ✅ PASS | Returns the list of favorite recipients |
| Updating a favorite recipient | ✅ PASS | Successfully updates nickname |
| Deleting a favorite recipient | ✅ PASS | Successfully removes from favorites |
| Invalid email format | ✅ PASS | Properly rejects invalid email formats |
| Non-existent recipient | ✅ PASS | Properly handles non-existent recipients |
| Special characters in nickname | ✅ PASS | Handles special characters correctly |
| Duplicate recipient | ✅ PASS | Prevents adding the same recipient twice |
| Transfer count tracking | ✅ PASS | Increments count when transfers are made |

### 2. Scheduled Transfers Functionality

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Creating a scheduled transfer | ✅ PASS | Successfully creates scheduled transfers |
| Retrieving scheduled transfers | ✅ PASS | Returns the list of scheduled transfers |
| Updating a scheduled transfer | ✅ PASS | Successfully updates schedule details |
| Deleting a scheduled transfer | ✅ PASS | Successfully removes scheduled transfers |
| Past execution date | ✅ PASS | Properly rejects past dates |
| Invalid date range | ✅ PASS | Properly handles invalid date ranges |
| Invalid frequency | ✅ PASS | Properly rejects invalid frequency values |
| Execution of scheduled transfers | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | Requires longer-term testing |

### 3. Notification System

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Retrieving notifications | ✅ PASS | Returns the list of notifications |
| Marking notifications as read | ✅ PASS | Successfully updates read status |
| Deleting notifications | ✅ PASS | Successfully removes notifications |
| Transfer notifications | ✅ PASS | Notifications created for transfers |
| Security event notifications | ✅ PASS | Notifications created for security events |
| Notification preferences | ✅ PASS | Respects user notification preferences |

### 4. Enhanced Security Features

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| High-value transfer threshold | ✅ PASS | Enforces additional authentication |
| Updating security settings | ✅ PASS | Successfully updates settings |
| Retrieving security settings | ✅ PASS | Returns current security settings |
| Trusted device management | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Basic functionality works, needs more testing |
| Notification preferences | ✅ PASS | Successfully updates preferences |

### 5. Integration with Existing Features

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Wallet-to-wallet transfers | ✅ PASS | Successfully transfers funds with test mode |
| Transaction history | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Summary works, filtering has issues |
| Transfer verification | ✅ PASS | OTP verification works correctly |
| Transfer status | ✅ PASS | Correctly reports transfer status |

## Issues Identified

1. **Wallet Balance Management**:
   - The test wallet has a zero balance, preventing full transfer testing
   - Funding mechanisms need improvement for testing purposes
   - Test mode works as a workaround for now

2. **Transaction Filtering**:
   - Error when trying to filter transactions: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
   - Possible issue with the transaction filtering endpoint implementation

3. **Scheduled Transfer Execution**:
   - Long-term testing needed to verify scheduled transfers execute correctly
   - Current testing only verifies creation, not execution

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Some edge cases for concurrent operations not fully tested
   - Need more testing for race conditions and high load scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Test Infrastructure**:
   - Create a more robust test environment with pre-funded wallets
   - Implement a mock payment system for testing wallet funding

2. **Fix Transaction Filtering**:
   - Debug and fix the transaction filtering endpoint
   - Ensure proper error handling for empty result sets

3. **Enhance Scheduled Transfer Testing**:
   - Create a time-accelerated test environment for scheduled transfers
   - Implement more comprehensive tests for different frequencies

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Conduct load testing to ensure system stability under high usage
   - Measure and optimize response times for critical operations

5. **Security Audit**:
   - Perform a comprehensive security audit of all endpoints
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, injection, etc.)

## Conclusion

The enhanced wallet functionality in the Purplepay backend is working as expected for most features. The favorite recipients, notification system, and security features are robust and handle edge cases appropriately. Some issues remain with transaction filtering and full testing of scheduled transfers, but these can be addressed with targeted fixes and additional testing.

The system is ready for limited production use, with monitoring in place for the identified areas of concern. With the recommended improvements, the wallet functionality will provide a secure and reliable platform for users to manage their finances.
