## Implementation Details

### Controller Functions

1. **getWalletDetails:** Retrieves the authenticated user's wallet details
2. **fundWallet:** Initiates a wallet funding transaction
3. **verifyFunding:** Verifies a wallet funding transaction and updates the wallet balance

### Routes

1. **GET /wallet/details:** Retrieves wallet details
2. **POST /wallet/fund:** Initiates wallet funding
3. **GET /wallet/verify-funding/:reference:** Verifies wallet funding

### Model Updates

The wallet model already had a balance field with a default value of 0, which is updated during the funding verification process.

## Observations and Recommendations

1. **Payment Gateway Integration:**
   - The current implementation simulates a payment gateway integration
   - In a production environment, this should be replaced with a real payment gateway like Paystack, Flutterwave, or Stripe

2. **Transaction History:**
   - Consider adding a transaction history feature to track all wallet funding transactions
   - This would require a new model for transactions

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add validation for the funding amount (minimum and maximum limits)
   - Consider adding two-factor authentication for large transactions

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Implement proper logging for debugging and auditing

## Conclusion

The wallet funding functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. All test cases have passed, and the system correctly updates the wallet balance after funding verification. The implementation is ready for integration with a real payment gateway in a production environment.

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with a real payment gateway**
2. **Implement transaction history**
3. **Add withdrawal functionality**
4. **Implement wallet-to-wallet transfers**
5. **Enhance security with two-factor authentication for transactions**
