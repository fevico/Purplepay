# Bills Payment API Testing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing approach and results for the Bills Payment API implementation in the Purplepay backend.

## Testing Approach

The testing approach consisted of the following steps:

1. **User Authentication Testing**
   - Creating test users
   - Obtaining JWT tokens
   - Verifying token validity

2. **Wallet Setup Testing**
   - Checking wallet balance
   - Funding wallet with test amount
   - Verifying updated balance

3. **Bills Payment API Testing**
   - Initiating bill payments for various bill types
   - Processing bill payments
   - Checking payment status
   - Retrieving payment history with filters

## Testing Tools

The following tools were created to facilitate testing:

1. **`create-test-user.js`**
   - Creates a test user with predefined credentials
   - Handles user verification
   - Obtains JWT token for API access

2. **`login-test.js`**
   - Logs in with existing user credentials
   - Obtains and saves JWT token to file

3. **`auto-create-test-user.js`**
   - Combines user creation, verification, and wallet setup
   - Provides a one-step solution for setting up test environment

4. **`test-bills-payment-api.js`**
   - Tests all Bills Payment API endpoints
   - Supports command-line options for customization
   - Handles error scenarios gracefully

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Electricity Bill Payment

- **Initiate Payment**
  - Bill Type: electricity
  - Provider: IKEDC
  - Amount: 5000 NGN
  - Expected Result: Payment initiated with pending status

- **Process Payment**
  - Expected Result: Payment processed successfully

- **Check Status**
  - Expected Result: Payment status updated to completed

### 2. Cable TV Subscription

- **Initiate Payment**
  - Bill Type: tv
  - Provider: DSTV
  - Amount: 8000 NGN
  - Expected Result: Payment initiated with pending status

- **Process Payment**
  - Expected Result: Payment processed successfully

- **Check Status**
  - Expected Result: Payment status updated to completed

### 3. Internet Subscription

- **Initiate Payment**
  - Bill Type: internet
  - Provider: MTN
  - Amount: 10000 NGN
  - Expected Result: Payment initiated with pending status

- **Process Payment**
  - Expected Result: Payment processed successfully

- **Check Status**
  - Expected Result: Payment status updated to completed

### 4. Payment History Filtering

- **Filter by Bill Type**
  - Expected Result: Only payments of specified type returned

- **Filter by Date Range**
  - Expected Result: Only payments within date range returned

- **Filter by Status**
  - Expected Result: Only payments with specified status returned

## Error Scenarios Tested

1. **Insufficient Wallet Balance**
   - Attempt to pay amount greater than wallet balance
   - Expected Result: Error response with appropriate message

2. **Invalid Customer Reference**
   - Provide non-existent customer reference
   - Expected Result: Error response with appropriate message

3. **Invalid Bill Type**
   - Provide unsupported bill type
   - Expected Result: Validation error

4. **Missing Required Fields**
   - Omit mandatory fields in request
   - Expected Result: Validation error

## Test Results

The Bills Payment API implementation has been thoroughly tested and the following results were observed:

1. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints are correctly implemented according to the specification.
2. **Authentication**: JWT authentication works as expected.
3. **Wallet Integration**: Wallet balance checking and deduction function correctly.
4. **Transaction Creation**: Transactions are created and linked to bill payments.
5. **Error Handling**: Appropriate error responses are returned for various error scenarios.

## Known Issues

1. **Email Notification**: Email notifications may fail if email service credentials are not properly configured.
2. **Provider API Integration**: Some provider-specific processing may require additional testing with actual provider APIs.

## Recommendations

1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure all environment variables are properly set up before deployment.
2. **Provider Testing**: Conduct additional testing with actual provider APIs in a staging environment.
3. **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure the API can handle expected traffic.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for API endpoints to track performance and errors.

## Conclusion

The Bills Payment API implementation meets the requirements and is ready for integration testing with the frontend application. The provided test scripts can be used for ongoing testing and verification during development and deployment.
