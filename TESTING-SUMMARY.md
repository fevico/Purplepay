# Purplepay Backend Testing Summary

## Completed Testing

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - ✅ User authentication (registration, verification, login)
   - ✅ Wallet creation and management
   - ✅ Favorite recipients (adding, retrieving, updating, deleting)
   - ✅ Scheduled transfers (creating, retrieving, updating, deleting)
   - ✅ Notifications (retrieving, marking as read, deleting)
   - ✅ Security settings (retrieving, updating)

2. **Edge Cases**
   - ✅ Invalid email formats for recipients
   - ✅ Non-existent recipients
   - ✅ Special characters in nicknames
   - ✅ Duplicate recipients
   - ✅ Negative/zero transfer amounts
   - ✅ Transfers below minimum amount
   - ✅ Very large transfer amounts
   - ✅ Past execution dates for scheduled transfers
   - ✅ Invalid date ranges for scheduled transfers
   - ✅ Invalid frequency for scheduled transfers

3. **Integration**
   - ✅ Security settings updates creating notifications
   - ✅ Transaction summary functionality
   - ✅ High-value transfer threshold enforcement

## Issues Identified

1. **Wallet Balance**
   - The test wallet has a zero balance, preventing successful transfer tests
   - Need to fund the wallet before testing transfers

2. **Transaction Filtering**
   - Error when trying to filter transactions: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
   - Possible issue with the transaction filtering endpoint

3. **Transaction Details**
   - Unable to test transaction details without a valid transaction reference
   - Depends on successful transfer tests

## Remaining Testing Needed

1. **Transfer Functionality**
   - Fund wallet and test complete transfer flow
   - Test transfer to favorite recipients
   - Test high-value transfers with additional authentication
   - Test transfers with various amounts and descriptions

2. **Scheduled Transfer Execution**
   - Test actual execution of scheduled transfers
   - Verify that scheduled transfers create proper transactions
   - Test different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)

3. **Transaction History**
   - Fix and test transaction filtering
   - Test transaction details retrieval
   - Test pagination and sorting options

4. **Concurrency and Performance**
   - Test multiple simultaneous transfers
   - Test system behavior under high load
   - Measure response times for critical operations

5. **Security Testing**
   - Test authentication enforcement for all endpoints
   - Test accessing resources belonging to other users
   - Test trusted device management more thoroughly

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Wallet Balance Issue**
   - Implement a proper wallet funding mechanism for testing
   - Update test scripts to ensure wallet has sufficient balance

2. **Fix Transaction Filtering**
   - Debug and fix the transaction filtering endpoint
   - Update test scripts to properly test filtering

3. **Complete Transfer Testing**
   - Once wallet is funded, complete transfer tests
   - Test integration between transfers, transactions, and notifications

4. **Load Testing**
   - Develop scripts for load testing critical endpoints
   - Test system behavior with many concurrent users

5. **Security Audit**
   - Perform a comprehensive security audit of all endpoints
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, injection, etc.)

## Conclusion

The Purplepay backend has a solid foundation with most core functionality working correctly. The main issues are related to wallet balance for testing transfers and some transaction filtering functionality. Once these issues are addressed, the remaining testing can be completed to ensure the system is robust, secure, and performs well under various conditions.
